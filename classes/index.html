            <h2 class="class-category-title"># Machine Learning</h2>

            <h3 id="10605" class="class-review">10-605: Machine Learning with Large Datasets (William Cohen)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
                This class introduces various techniques for handling large datasets and in particular introduces Apache Spark as one method. Every single lecture in this class is surprisingly relevant for how easy/obvious it seems until the professor drops a nugget of gold in one slide in the middle of lecture. Multi-armed bandit and LSH somehow live rent-free in my head. This is a high-quality, relevant, and easy ML class to take.  
            </div>

            <h3 id="10701" class="class-review">10-701: Introduction to Machine Learning (Nina Balcan)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            This is the graduate introduction to machine learning class (as opposed to the undergraduate 10-315 for SCS and 10-301 for non-SCS). My general philosophy is: why take the undergraduate version of a class if you can take the graduate version? This version with Nina stole a lot of homework from when she previously taught 10-715, the "advanced" ML PhD-only introduction to ML, which was... interesting. I came out of this course without too much retention of machine learning but with a LOT of knowledge about and love for kernels and learning theory, which I take as a good sign :). Overall, not a particularly memorable class unfortunately (except that this was the first time I ever tried office hours at CMU, only to wait in the OH queue for OVER 15 HOURS over several days without ever getting off of it).
            </div>

            <h3 id="10707" class="class-review">10-707: Advanced Deep Learning (Ruslan Salakhutdinov)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            Ruslan is by a long shot the best lecturer I've had the privilege of listening to. No other lecture has left me learning so much, understanding so quickly, or leaving so impressed by their sheer oratory ability. Ruslan takes the cake by a long shot. If you ever have the opportunity to take a class with him, please do!!

            Aside from that, the course is a fairly standard (but highly enjoyable!) deep learning course with a fun course project and excellent teaching. I think all of the deep learning course offerings are strong in their own aspects, but take this class if you care a lot about theory. 
            </div>
            
            <h3 id="10708" class="class-review">10-708: Probabilistic Graphical Models (Albert Gu, Andrej Risteski)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            <p>Albert (Goomba Lab!) and Andrej are the goats, what more do I need to say? Both are excellent professors, and Andrej is exceptional. The course is the most well-organized course in terms of structure and content that I've ever taken. Every sentence/every slide has a purpose, and it's evident that considerable thought was put into thinking about how to present the content. This class has also reinspired me to take (1) more theoretical/harder ML classes going forward and (2) more probability. Unfortunately, I still don't know what PGMs are useful for...</p>

            <p>They added exams this semester to this class, which makes the class a much more stressful experience. This class is known for having some of the most difficult ML homeworks/exams, but the payoff is correspondingly higher :). </p>
                </div>
                
            <h3 id="10714" class="class-review">10-714: Deep Learning Systems (Tianqi Chen, Tim Dettmers)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            The two professors for this class are excellent and insanely cracked. The course itself suffers from lack of assumed prerequisites, so while this class would be an excellent first machine learning class to take, much of it is redundant with previous courses that I've taken. Needle is a fun course project to work on (definitely the highlight of my week!) and the general idea of MLSys and kernel fusion is super interesting. I'm coming out of this course with an inspiration to take a more specialized MLSys class after this.
            </div>

            <h3 id="15592" class="class-review">15-592: Independent Study in Computer Science (Chenyan Xiong)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            Research/independent study class. Project: sparse attention.
            </div>

            <h2 class="class-category-title"># Computer Systems</h2>

            <h3 id="15213" class="class-review">15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems (Brian Railing, Phillip Gibbons)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            I must confess I have zero memory whatsoever of either professor existing for this class, largely due to my lacking attendance. This class is one of the more chill CS cores and an easy A: all you do is code! Doing the programmings for this class was definitely one of the highlights of my week while I Was taking this (except bomblab was deviously stressful). The programming assignments after malloc (which was peak!) fell off as more and more systems stuff was abstracted away: but this is just a sign to go take more systems classes! Overall, a very enjoyable and chill class with shocking relevance to life.
            </div>

            <h3 id="15411" class="class-review">15-411: Compiler Design (Seth Goldstein, Ben Titzer)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            <p>I say this a lot, but this class is truly one of the greatest of all time. Never before has any class consumed my mind and every waking moment to the extent that this one has. Never before has any class bonded me in the way this one does. Never before has any CS anything lived so rent-free in my head (yes a semester after the fact I DO still think about my compiler on at least a weekly basis). This class is the uncrowned jewel of SCS. TAKE IT! It has converted almost everyone [relevant] I know to starting compilers/compilers-adjacent research. That's how good it is.</p>

            <p>The lectures are well-taught although FAR too early in the morning and often not one-to-one with compiler progress. I took this class because I was told that it's the "best run 400-level systems class," which I believe to be true. This class is also known for having a more PL-flavor than most compilers classes at other schools. The TAs for this course were outstanding (Ivan is my GOAT) and made recitation a delight to attend. The core project (coding a compiler) was incredibly fun (which I can say post-Stockholming this class). Also, OCaml is a lovely language and C0 is awesome! I've never written, annotated, or read as much assembly in my life as when I was debugging each lab for this class. SSA (static single assignment) is the devil: it's incredibly useful, yet criminal to actually implement.</p>
            
            <p>Some more practical notes: the class essentially consists of you writing a compiler for C0 to x86-64 assembly ultimately competitive with GCC's -O1 flag in five phases/"labs": (1) straight-line code (2) control statements (3) functions (4) memory (5) optimizations. 

            Because each part builds on the previous parts, you are heavily punished for your tech debt (and this is reflected in the grading, where you can't regress on previous tests or continue failing on tests you failed on before).</p>

            <p>As a side note: some people wrote EVIL test cases so watch out because I'm coming for you vulcan / barsoomian / robert...</p>

            Reiterating this one more time: take compilers!! 
            </div>


            <h2 class="class-category-title"># Computer Science</h2>


            <h3 id="05391" class="class-review">05-391: Designing Human Centered Software (Sauvik Das)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            I took this class because computer graphics conflicts with 15-451. This class is excellent for socializing and digging out all of the non-SCS people of CMU that you know. Unfortunately, the learning in this class is negative: when Fitt's Law is introduced, the professor prefaces it with "this lecture is going to be much more theoretical and mathematically advanced, so be prepared," and pulls out... a logarithm. Goomba eats this for breakfast! It turns out that a LOT of designing human-centered software is following your intuitions and then rapidly iterating on that with real user testing. Unless you're pressed about graduation or want an easy semester, I'd recommend taking a more theoretical class for your domains elective. 
            </div>

            <h3 id="07128" class="class-review">07-128: First-Year Immigration Course (Tom Cortina, Veronica Peet)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            My two GOATs of SCS teaching one class. What could be better? It was honestly a very fun and core bonding experience, and I do believe that it's important to bring all of SCS into a classroom together. Unfortunately, the only lectures I remember are Michael Skirpan's series of <i>five</i> ethics lectures?! Egregious.
            </div>

            <h3 id="15122" class="class-review">15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation (Iliano Cervesato)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            The first of all CS classes; the one that inducts you into the great SCS :). It's fun just coding. Also the first introduction to the greatness of: 1) C0 2) amortized analysis 3) pre-conditions/post-conditions/contracts. I learned all I know about pointers from this class!
                </div>


            <h3 id="15150" class="class-review">15-150: Functional Programming (Michael Erdmann)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            Functional programming is one of the greatest things of CS. Sadly, this class could be shortened into a one-week introduction to SML and still contain the same amount of content. Behold the gateway to true computer sciences glory (210/411/451) :D. CPS was very fun. 
            </div>

            <h3 id="15210" class="class-review">15-210: Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms (Guy Blelloch, Charlie Garrod)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            What goes MOO? Clarabelle! This class has one of the cutest and cuddliest mascots of all time, and the class was very fun (implement well-known algorithms in SML!). Taking this class made me a demon at interviews this semester, and I've since fallen off :(. Problem solving is very, very fun, even if the knowledge gain is less than epsilon. This class is possibly my favorite core because it integrates both programmings and writtens into the assignments. 
            </div>

            <h3 id="15251" class="class-review">15-251: Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science (Anil Ada, Feras Saad)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            Titled one of the hardest of the CS "cores," this class is an average introduction to theoretical computer science. The content is presented well, but the format with the weekly "writing sessions" made taking the class itself an undelightful experience. The course picked up a lot into the second half as we left complexity behind in favor of algorithms—I do confess that complexity classes are not my cup of tea. I left this class with a mild distaste for TCS that was only cured by taking Randomized Algorithms (which is arguably a very niche subfield of TCS).
            </div>


            <h3 id="15756" class="class-review">15-756: Randomized Algorithms (William Kuszmaul)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            This course was a special topics course taught in Kuszmaul's first semester at CMU, and it is one of my all-time favorites at CMU. Extremely chill, extemely educational; every class was a delight to attend. This is how all classes should be structured and taught. Kuszmaul is one of the greats for sure. Taking this class reignited my love for (1) algorithms/data structures/TCS (2) probability in the best way possible. The only caveat is... no industry advancement has been made in the field of randomized algorithms in years :(. But this is independent of the quality of class. If you ever have an opportunity to take a class with Kuszmaul, take it!
            </div>

            <h3 id="17200" class="class-review">17-200: Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing (Michael Skirpan, James Herbsleb)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            ETHICS! The hype from FIC never wore off. I took this class for the mandatory "technical writing" requirement, and overall, it was a decent class that tries to apply literary frames/techniques to the nebulous field of ethics. The professors are evidently quite good at teaching/rambling and care a lot about both the field and the class, even if the content was a bit meh at times. Class discussions were highly engaging, and the one ethics conference I went to for the free Venezuelan catering was extremely... engagement-inducing, let's say (the topic: is AI in education rotting people's brains?). Participation in this class is complete and utter FRAUD though. 
            </div>

            <h2 class="class-category-title"># Mathematics</h2>
            <h3 id="21242" class="class-review">21-242: Matrix Theory (Riley Thornton)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            This class was... a rude introduction to CMU math classes. I suspect typical iterations of this class are much higher quality, but my year had an FCE rating of 2/5, largely owing to the instructor's relative newness at CMU and lack of prior teaching experience. Additionally, the recitation TA (Robert) was particularly misaligned with course content which, while entertaining, was detrimental to the actual linear algebra course experience. Overall, the course was adequate for an introduction to linear algebra, but it suffered from inexperienced teaching, and exams were a surprise.
            </div>



            <h3 id="21269" class="class-review">21-269: Vector Analysis (Giovanni Leoni)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            I would generally recommend taking this over 21-268 for pure enjoyment, although you will come out of this class with no multivariate calculus knowledge (but rather analysis knowledge). Leoni is an excellent lecturer, and, while technically illegal at CMU, I adore the format of his exams (unlimited cheatsheet pages, unlimited time on a weekend, typically a Saturday). A funny story: on the midterm, I set my alarm to the wrong time, woke up over an hour late, ran to the classroom, claimed I misremembered the start time by two hours, and ended up acing it ;). Time limits are usually the performance limiter, not your IQ points. On the other hand, the quizzes during Tuesday 2pm recitation cooked me—true/false and theorem roulette are not my strong suites, and I spent all morning memorizing results from class.
            </div>

            <h3 id="21325" class="class-review">21-325: Probability (Andrew Newman)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            This is the "math" probability class (as opposed to the CS probability PnC 21-259 and the stats probability classes, 36-225+36-226). It's a convenient class to take because you can easily waive the multivariate calculus prerequisite and it has no 251 prerequisite, unlike the others, and it presents itself as "mathematically rigorous." The course itself was a reasonable introduction to probability: Newman lectures well, and the content is all standard. The exams was particularly easy. I do know that this course varies notoriously by professor; Pisztora seemed to have the worse section. I enjoyed the class but I was left wanting to take a harder probability class in the future :), which is maybe the best feeling a class can leave you with (excitement to learn more!). 
            </div>


            <h3 id="21651" class="class-review">21-651: General Topology (Florian Frick)</h3>
            
            <div class="class-review-text">
            One of the math classes of all time, I would recommend anyone remotely interested in math to take this course. The content is beautiful on its owns, but Frick is a brilliant lecturer and he takes it to the next level. At the same time, the exams are the hardest I've ever taken during my time at CMU.
            </div>


            <h2 class="class-category-title"># Humanities/Sciences</h2>

            <h3 id="33104" class="class-review">33-104: Experimental Physics (Valentina Dutta)</h3>

            <div class="class-review-text">
            The professor and the TA (Aleesha Kallil Tharayil) are both extremely cracked and very, very nice. The class is pretty fun because you get to meet and chat with a lot of people in CS you wouldn't otherwise, but the length and time of the labs is a bit egregious. Very chill lab class to take.
            </div>

            <h3 id="76221" class="class-review">76-221: Books You Should Have Read By Now (Pearl Nielsen)</h3>


            <div class="class-review-text">
            This is the best gened I've taken at CMU to date. The discussion-based class format was excellent, the essays were all a pleasure to write. The books we read were all surprisingly relevant: My Brother, Never Let Me Go, Frankenstein, Cutting for Stone, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The topic we focused on was medicine in literature, which was pretty interesting (albeit somewhat shallow due to authors' lacking medical background). In particular, I really enjoyed writing my essay on <i>Never Let Me Go</i>. If this course counted for multiple gened requirements, I would take it every semester :").

            I took this class because I thought it counted for a category 2 humanities... as it turns out, it doesn't. This class was extremely pro-western and memorization-heavy (I will never forget LEO and MEO and GEO), take that for what you will.
